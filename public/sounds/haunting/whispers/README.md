# Whispers Audio Layer

This directory contains whisper audio files for the whispers layer of the advanced haunting system.

## Requirements

- **Trigger Condition**: Possession level > 70 AND user name detected
- **Playback Interval**: Random intervals between 30-90 seconds
- **Volume**: 60% of base volume (quieter, more unsettling)

## Audio Files

### generic-1.mp3
Generic whisper sound that plays when user name is detected but personalized audio is not available.

**Specifications**:
- Format: MP3
- Bitrate: 64kbps (recommended for small file size)
- Duration: 2-5 seconds
- Content: Unintelligible whispers, breathy sounds, or soft murmuring
- Volume: Should be mixed at a low level to create unease

### Future Files

For personalized whispers (future enhancement):
- Text-to-speech generated whispers of user's name
- Pre-recorded name variations
- Context-aware whispers based on user actions

## Audio Design Notes

Whispers should:
- Be barely audible to create uncertainty ("Did I hear that?")
- Have a breathy, ethereal quality
- Avoid being too loud or startling (this is tension, not jumpscare)
- Layer well with other audio (ambient, effects, tension)
- Create a sense of being watched or followed

## Placeholder Audio

Until proper audio files are created, the system will gracefully handle missing files by logging errors without breaking functionality.
