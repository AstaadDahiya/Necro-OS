# Cursor Assets

This directory contains cursor sprites for the Necro-OS visual corruption system.

## Files

- `arrow.svg` - Standard Windows 95 style arrow cursor
- `arrow-corrupted.svg` - Glitched/corrupted cursor variant with RGB shift and artifacts

## Usage

These cursors are used by the CursorCorruption.vue component to replace the default system cursor with custom sprites that can be manipulated and corrupted as the haunting level increases.
